<h3>COWPER AND TOBACCO SMOKING.</h3>

  <p>The following genial and characteristic letter from the poet, having
  escaped the research of the <span class="sc">Rev. T. S. Grimshaw</span>,
  may be thought worthy of transference from the scarce and ephemeral
  <i>brochure</i> in which it has, as far as I am aware, alone appeared, to
  your more permanent and attainable repertory. The little work alluded to
  is entitled <i>Convivialia et Saltatoria, or a few Thoughts upon Feasting
  and Dancing</i>, a poem in two parts, &amp;c., by G. Orchestikos: London,
  printed for the author, 1800, pp. 62. At page 39 will be found</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nicotiana: a Poetical Epistle in praise of Tobacco; intended as a
  refutation of the ill-founded remarks of William Cowper, Esq. respecting
  this plant, in his elegant poem on Conversation. By Phil. Nicot.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The man I pity who abhors the fume</p>
      <p>Of fine <i>Virginia</i> floating in his room;</p>
      <p>For, truly may Tobacco be defined,</p>
      <p>A Plant preserving Health and Peace of mind.</p>
      <p class="i9">1800."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p>Next follows the poem, dedicated "To the Tobacconists in general of
  England and its colonies," and consisting of some 350 lines, concluding
  with the following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Now by way of a Postscript, for I cannot conclude</p>
      <p>Without <i>once more</i> entreating, that you'll be so good</p>
      <p>As to favour me with an Epistle, and soon,</p>
      <p>Which in <i>my</i> estimation will be such a boon</p>
      <p>That I'll <i>carefully</i> keep it; and dying, take care</p>
      <p>To enjoin like Respect from my Son or my Heir;</p>
      <p>And lest He should forget its great Value to ask,</p>
      <p class="i9">Shall say,</p>
      <p>It was wrote by the Hand, that first wrote out the Task:</p>
      <p>No more I need mention, its Worth will appear,</p>
      <p>And be kept as a Relic I <i>justly</i> hold dear."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Next comes the poet's kindly response:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Dear Sir,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"It is not in my power to send you an epistle that will entitle itself
  to any of the <i>honours</i> which you are so good as to promise to one
  from me. My time is not my own, but is partly engaged in attendance on a
  dear friend, who has long been in a very helpless state, <!-- Page 230
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>{230}</span>and partly to
  the performance of what I owe to the public, a new edition of my Homer,
  and also of the poetical works of Milton.</p>

  <p>"With these labours in hand, together with the common avocations
  incident to everybody, it is hardly possible that I should have
  opportunities for writing letters. In fact, I am in debt to most of my
  friends, and to many of them have been long in debt, whose claims upon me
  are founded in friendship of long standing. To this cause you will be so
  good as to ascribe it, that I have not sooner thanked you for your
  humorous and pleasant contest with me on the subject of <span
  class="sc">Tobacco</span>; a contest in which I have not, at present,
  leisure to exercise myself, otherwise I am hardy enough to flatter
  myself, that I could take off the force of some of your arguments.</p>

  <p>"Should you execute your design of publishing what you have favoured
  me with a sight of, I heartily wish success to your muse militant, and
  that your reward may be&mdash;many a pleasant pipe supplied by the
  profits of your labours.</p>

  <p>"Being in haste, I can add no more, except that I am, with respect,
  and a due sense of the honour you do me,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Your obliged, &amp;c.,</p>
      <p><span class="sc">William Cowper</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Weston-Underwood,</p>
      <p>Oct. 4, 1793."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</blockquote>

  <p>I hope that the above will be interesting to your Nicotian readers,
  and not trespass too far upon your valuable space.</p>

  <p><i>Snuff and Tobacco.</i>&mdash;It is perhaps not generally known that
  the custom of taking snuff is of Irish origin. In a "Natural History of
  Tobacco," in the <i>Harleian Misc.</i>, i. 535., we are told
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Virginians were observed to have pipes of clay before ever the
  English came there; and from those barbarians we Europeans have borrowed
  our mode and fashion of smoking.... <i>The Irishmen do most commonly
  powder their tobacco, and snuff it up their nostrils</i>, which some of
  our Englishmen do, who often chew and swallow it."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>That the clay pipe was the original smoking apparatus in England, is
  evident from the following lines in Skelton's <i>Eleanor Rummin</i>.
  After lamenting the knavery of that age compared with King Harry's time,
  he continues:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nor did that time know,</p>
      <p>To puff and to blow,</p>
      <p>In a peece of white clay,</p>
      <p>As you do at this day,</p>
      <p>With fier and coale,</p>
      <p>And a leafe in a hole," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>These lines are from an edition of 1624, printed in the <i>Harl.
  Misc.</i>, i. 415. Skelton died in 1529, and according to the generally
  received accounts, tobacco was not introduced into this country till
  1565, or thereabouts; so the lines cannot be Skelton's. They are part of
  an introduction to the tale of <i>Eleanor Rummin</i>. Is the author
  known?</p>

<h3>"SHAKSPEARE IN THE SHADES:" A BALLAD.</h3>

  <p>The ballad, entitled "Shakspeare's Bedside," inserted in your pages
  (Vol. vii., p. 104.), was printed (probably for the first time) in a
  collection of poems called <i>The Muse's Mirrour</i>, 2 vols. 8vo.,
  printed for Robert Baldwin, 1778. It occurs at p. 90. of the first
  volume; and at p. 159. of the same volume I find another Shakspearian
  ballad, which, as the book is rare, I transcribe for the benefit of your
  readers. The work in question contains a number of clever effusions by
  the poets and wits of the last half of the eighteenth century. The
  anonymous compiler thus commences his preface:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The editor and collector of the following poems does not conceive it
  necessary to make any apology for what he has done; but arrogates to
  himself the right of some attention for the collecting of such pieces as
  would have died upon their births, although the productions of the best
  poets and men of genius <i>for the last twenty years</i>."</p>

  <p><i>The Biter; an attempt at Comedy</i>, by Rowe, which was received

  <a name="footnote2"></a><b>Footnote 2:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag2">(return)</a>
  <p>Theobald, in the preface to his first edition of Shakspeare, asserts
  that, exclusive of the works of Beaumont and Fletcher, and Ben Jonson, he
  had read above eight hundred plays, to ascertain the uncommon and
  obsolete phrases in his author. The reader who can discover the fruits of
  this boasted industry in his notes may safely believe him; and those who
  cannot may surely claim the liberty, like myself, to doubt somewhat of
  his veracity. This assertion, however, Theobald had sufficient modesty to
  omit in the preface to his second edition, together with all the
  criticisms on Greek authors, which I am assured he had collected from
  such papers of Mr. Wycherley as had been entrusted to his care for very
  different purposes. It is much to be questioned whether there are five
  hundred old plays extant, by the most accurate perusal of which the works
  of Shakspeare could receive advantage; I mean of dramas prior,
  cotemporary, or within half a century before and after his own.</p>

<h3>SWEDISH WORDS CURRENT IN ENGLAND.</h3>

  <p>In the summer of 1847 I mentioned to my friend Professor Retzius at
  Stockholm, certain Scandinavian words in use at Whitby, with which he was
  much pleased, they not being akin to the German. I have since been mostly
  in the South of Europe, but have not lost sight of these words; and last
  spring I wrote out in Switzerland upwards of five hundred Swedish words,
  which greatly resemble the English, Lowland Scots, &amp;c., but I doubt
  many of them have the same root with the German correspondents. I now beg
  you kindly to offer to the notice of our Anglo-Saxon and Icelandic
  scholars, as well as the estimable Northern <i>savans</i> at Copenhagen
  and elsewhere, the following words in use at Whitby, and I believe
  throughout Cleveland and Cumberland, where the local accent and manner of
  speaking is the same.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Agg orm</i>, Swedish (viper), <i>agg worm</i>, Whitby (pron.
  w&#x14D;rrum).&mdash;<i>Bloa b√¶r</i> (bilbery), blue
  berry.&mdash;<i>By</i> (village), as a termination to names of towns,
  occurs, perhaps, more frequently in this district than in others; there
  are some places in Cleveland called Lund and Upsal.&mdash;<i>B√¶ck</i>
  (brook), beck.&mdash;<i>Djevul</i> (devil), pronounced exactly in the
  Swedish manner at Whitby.&mdash;<i>Doalig</i> (poorly),
  dowly.&mdash;<i>Eldon</i> (tinder-box), applied to
  faggots.&mdash;<i>Fors</i> (waterfall), spelt force and foss in Yorkshire
  books.&mdash;<i>Ful</i> (ugly), pron. fool, usually associated with
  bigness in Cleveland.&mdash;<i>Foane</i> (silly), pron. fond at
  Whitby.&mdash;<i>Giller</i> (snare), guilder.&mdash;<i>G√¶pen</i>
  (handful), gowpen.&mdash;<i>Harr</i> (grayling), carrling in
  Ryedale.&mdash;<i>K√¶tt</i> (flesh), kett, applied to coarse
  meat.&mdash;<i>Lek</i> (play), at Whitby, to lake.&mdash;<i>Leta</i> (to
  seek), to late at Whitby.&mdash;<i>Lie</i> (scythe), pron.
  lye.&mdash;<i>Lingon</i> (red bilberry), called a ling
  berry.&mdash;<i>Ljung</i> (ling).&mdash;<i>Lopp</i> (a
  flea).&mdash;<i>N√¶bb</i> (beak), neb.&mdash;<i>Skaft</i> (handle),
  skaft.&mdash;<i>Sk√¶r</i> (rock), Whitby skar.&mdash;<i>Smitta</i> (to
  infect), to smit.&mdash;<i>Strandgata</i> (creek), at Whitby
  ghaut.&mdash;<i>St√¶d</i> (anvil), steady.&mdash;<i>S√¶f</i> (a rush),
  siv.&mdash;<i>Tjarn</i> (pool), tarn.&mdash;<i>Oenska</i> (to wish for),
  we say to set one an onska, <i>i.e.</i> longing or wishing."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Will any one inform me which of the above are Anglo-Saxon words? I may
  add that there are many French words in the Swedish for aught I know,
  some of them Norman. As we find German words in the Italian, we may
  expect to find Scandinavian in the French.</p>

<h3>SIR DAVID LINDSAY'S VIRIDARIUM.</h3>

  <p>In Lord Lindsay's very interesting <i>Lives of the Lindsays</i>, vol.
  i. p. 347., after the description of the very curious "viridarium or
  garden" of Sir David Lindsay at Edzell, and of the various sculptures and
  ornaments with which its wall is decorated, the author says: "To show how
  insecure was enjoyment in that dawn of refinement, the centre of every
  star along the wall forms an embrasure for the extrusion, if needed, of
  arrow, harquebuss, or pistol."</p>

  <p>Some years before the book was published, I had visited this very
  interesting spot, and examined these sculptures, and other ornaments,
  amongst which the <i>pierced stars</i> puzzled me much: however, after a
  lengthened and very careful investigation, finding that, being at too
  great a height from the ground, and, moreover, that as the holes in the
  centre of the stars do not pass through the wall, but merely into small
  cavities in it, they could not have been used as embrasures, or have
  served for warlike purposes; and that, as there were no channels or pipes
  that could have <!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page232"></a>{232}</span>conducted water to them, they could not
  have been connected with fountains or water-works; I came to the
  conclusion that the planner of the garden, or at least of its walls, must
  have been an ardent lover of birds, and that these holes were for
  providing access for his beloved feathered friends (they would only admit
  the passage of <i>small</i> birds) to the secure resting-places which the
  hollow stones afforded; for whose use other niches and recesses seem also
  to have been planned (though some of the latter were probably intended to
  hold bee-hives) with a philornithic indifference for the security of the
  fruit tempting their attacks from all sides, but quite in character with
  the portrait of Sir David, as depicted by his noble biographer.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>WILD PLANTS AND THEIR NAMES.</h3>

  <p>In looking over some memoranda, I find the following Queries entered;
  and, as it is more than probable that some of the readers of "N. &amp;
  Q." who take an interest in our wild flowers, and love the simple, homely
  names which were given them by our fathers, will easily solve them, I
  send them for insertion:</p>

  <p>1. <i>Capsella</i>, <i>Bursa pastoris</i>, "Shepherd's Purse." Why was
  this plant called "St. James's Wort;" French, "Fleur de St. Jacques?" Was
  it used in medicine? Its old name, "Poor Man's Parmacetic," would imply
  that it was.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Veronica Cham√¶drys</i>, "Eye-bright," "Paul's Betony," and
  "Fluellin." What was the origin of these two names?</p>

  <p>3. <i>Primula veris</i>, "Cowslip," "Palsy Wort;" French, "Herbe de la
  Paralysie." Is this plant used in any of our village pharmacop&oelig;ias
  as a remedy for palsy; and if so, how? I may also add another Query on
  this plant, and which I trust some <i>fair</i> reader will answer; and
  that is, How is the ointment prepared from the leaves (?), which is used
  to remove tan and freckles from the sunburnt?</p>

  <p>4. <i>Viburnum opulus</i>, "Guelder Rose." Was this plant originally a
  native of the Low Countries? I am inclined to think that its distribution
  was of a very wide range.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Neottia spiralis</i>, "Ladies' Tresses," "Sweet Cods," "Sweet
  Cullins," and "Stander Grass." What is the origin of these names?</p>

  <p>6. <i>Ribes nigrum</i>, "Black Currant," "Gazel" (Kent). Meaning?</p>

  <p>7. <i>Stellaria holostea</i>, "Stitchwort," "All-bones." Meaning? The
  plant is very fragile.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Orobus tuberosus</i>, "Bitter Vetch," "Cormeille" (Highlands of
  Scotland), and "Knapperts" (Scotland generally). Have these terms any
  signification?</p>

  <p>9. <i>Sinapis arvensis</i>, "Wild Mustard," "Charlock," "Garlock,"
  "Chadlock," and "Runsh." Derivation and meaning?</p>

  <p>10. <i>Saxifraga umbrosa</i>, "London Pride," "Saxifrage," "St.
  Patrick's Cabbage." Is there a legend in connexion with this name; and in
  what county is this saxifrage so called?</p>

  <p>11. <i>Geum urbanum</i>, "Yellow Avens," "Herb Bennet," "Star of the
  North," "Blessed Herb." These names would appear to point to some virtues
  supposed to be attached to this herb. What are they?</p>

  <p>12. <i>Linum catharticum</i>, "Purge Flax," "Mill Mountain"?</p>

  <p>13. <i>Sedum acre</i>, "Biting Stone-crop," "Jack of the Buttery,"
  "Pricket," "Bird's Bread"?</p>

  <p>14. <i>Gnaphalium germanicum</i>, "Common Cudweed," "Wicked Herb"
  (<i>Herba impia</i>), "Live-long," and "Chaff-weed."</p>

  <p>15. <i>Euphorbia helioscopia</i>, "Sun Spurge," "Churn-staff"? juice
  milky, but acrid.</p>

  <p>16. <i>Euphorbia cyparissius</i>, "Cypress Spurge," "Welcome to our
  House"?</p>

  <p>17. <i>Chrysanthemum segetum</i>, "Wild Marigold," "Goules," "Goulans"
  (Query remains of its old name gold?), "St. John's Bloom," "Ruddes"?</p>

  <p>18. <i>Spergula arvensis</i>, "Spurrey Yarr" (Scotch)?</p>

  <p>19. <i>Chenapodium Bonus Henricus</i>, "Mercury Goose-foot," "Good
  King Henry"?</p>

  <p>To all the latter the same Query will apply, What is the origin of the
  name? It is probable but few of the above names will be now found; or, if
  found, it will be only in those districts where the march of intellect
  (?) has not banished all traces of household surgery, home legends, and,
  I may almost add, home feelings.</p>

  <p>Much that is interesting to the antiquary and the naturalist is now
  fast fading out of the land. The very existence of the cheap literature
  of the day will rapidly root out all traces of traditionary lore; and
  strong, <i>steady</i> efforts should be made to rescue as much as
  possible of it from oblivion. It is with this view I send these Queries;
  and in case they are deemed worthy of insertion, I purpose to follow them
  up by a second list of Queries, as to the medical virtues of our wild
  plants. In the mean time I may add, that any Notes on them, whether as
  charms or cures, would be most desirable.</p>

<h3>POPULAR SAYINGS.</h3>

  <p>I would feel obliged, Mr. Editor, if you or any of your North of

  of "N. &amp; Q.," with the origin and meaning of the following popular
  local sayings, peculiar to the North Countrie.</p>

  <p>Likewise permit me to observe, that if any of them can favour me,
  through either of the above channels, with a few more of the "dark
  sayings of antiquity," either in the form of plain prose or rude rustic
  rhymes, peculiar to any or all of the five northern counties, to wit,
  York, Durham, Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, they would
  not only be conferring an obligation upon myself, but likewise upon every
  one of your numerous readers who take pleasure in the fast-fading

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Hermit Queries.</i>&mdash;1. Some years ago a hermitage existed in
  certain grounds at Chelsea, the proprietor of which frequently advertised
  for a hermit, and, I believe, never got one. Who was the proprietor of
  the said hermitage; and did he ever succeed in getting his toy
  tenanted?</p>

  <p>2. In Gilbert White's poem, <i>Invitation to Selborne</i>, the
  following lines occur:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Or where the hermit hangs the straw-clad cell,</p>
      <p>Emerging gently from the leafy dell,</p>
      <p>By fancy plann'd," &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The only edition of the "Letters" which I possess, is that by Sir
  William Jardine and Mr. Jesse, which affords a note on the passage, to
  the effect that the hermitage referred to was used by a young gentleman,
  who appeared occasionally "in the character of a hermit." What was the
  name of the eccentric, and what is known of his hermit life? Is the
  hermitage still in existence?</p>

  <p>3. Where is to be found the best account of anchorites, real and
  fictitious?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Shirley Hibberd.</span></p>

  <p><i>Derivation of "Cobb."</i>&mdash;What is the derivation of the word
  <i>Cobb</i>? There is but one harbour of that name in England, that of
  Lyme Regis: there was once another at Swanage. This was also styled, some
  three centuries ago, the "Cobb or Conners."</p>

  <p>Query: What is the derivation of the family name "Cobham?"</p>

  <p class="author">G. R. L.</p>

  <p><i>Play-bills.</i>&mdash;Will any of your correspondents inform me in
  what year play-bills were first introduced; and at what period the
  <i>year</i> was added to the day of the month and week, which only is
  attached to the early bills?</p>

  <p class="author">J. N. G. G.</p>

  <p><i>Sir Edward Grymes, Bart.</i>&mdash;A correspondent in a recent
  number of the <i>Naval and Military Gazette</i>, asks who was Sir Edward
  Grymes, Bart., whose appointment appeared in the <i>War Office
  Gazette</i> of December 10, 1776, as surgeon's mate to the garrison at
  Minorca, when the baronetcy came into the family, when he died, and
  whether a gentleman of the same rank has ever, before or since that
  period, served in a similar situation in the English army?</p>

  <p>I have transferred these Queries to the columns of "N. &amp; Q.,"
  supposing that they might be answered by some of its correspondents.</p>

  <p><i>Smollett's Strap.</i>&mdash;In "N. &amp; Q.," Vol. iii., p. 123.,
  is an extract from the <i>Examiner</i>, March 26, 1809, relating to Hugh
  Hewson, who is there mentioned as being "no less a personage than the
  identical Hugh Strap."</p>

  <p>Mr. Faulkner, in his <i>History of Chelsea</i>, vol. i. p. 171.,
  states that Mr. W. Lewis, of Lombard Street, Chelsea, was the original of
  this character. He established himself in Chelsea by Smollett's advice,
  and died there about 1785. Faulkner states that he resided with his widow
  for seven years, and thus having opportunities of being acquainted with
  the facts, I am inclined to give his account the preference. Now that
  these different accounts are brought forward, some reader of "N. &amp;
  Q." may be enabled with certainty to fix who was the identical.</p>

  <p class="author">H. G. D.</p>

  <p><i>The Iron Mask.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. James Cornish</span>
  (Vol. v., p. 474.) says, that "after half a century's active exertions,
  the Iron Mask was unveiled," and this sanguine person gives it also as
  his opinion that the author of <i>Junius's Letters</i> will "eventually
  be unearthed." The last event may perhaps happen; but what authority has
  he for asserting that the mysterious secret of the "Masque de Fer" has
  ever been satisfactorily explained? Numerous, learned, and ingenious, as
  many of the hypotheses on the subject have been for upwards of a century,
  I have always imagined that an impenetrable veil of secrecy still
  continued to cover this wonderful historical mystery.</p>

  <p><i>Thomas Gibbes of Fenton.</i>&mdash;Can any of your genealogical
  readers tell me what other issue (if any) there was of the marriage of
  Thomas Gibbes of Fenton, in the parish of Dartington, in the county of
  Devon, and Anne, daughter of Sir William Courtenay of Powderham, besides
  their son William Gibbes, who died in London <span class="sm">A.D.</span>
  1570?</p>

  <p>Also whether John Gibbes of Fenton, father of the above-named Thomas
  Gibbes, who married the heiress of William May or Mey, had any other
  issue?</p>

  <p><i>"The Whipping Toms" at Leicester.</i>&mdash;A singular annual
  custom, under the above designation, formerly prevailed in this town,
  from time immemorial, on Shrove Tuesday. It is unnecessary to take up
  your valuable space with a detailed account of it, as it is fully
  described in Throsby's <i>History of Leicester</i>, p. 356., and in
  Hone's <i>Year-Book</i>, p. 538.</p>

  <p>My object is to inquire if any custom at all analogous to it is known
  to have existed elsewhere, and, if so, what is the supposed origin of
  it?</p>

  <p>Nothing whatever is known of the origin of the custom in this town,
  beyond a vague popular tradition that it was instituted (like several
  other curious customs) by John of Gaunt, during his lengthened residence
  in the castle within what was then termed "The New-Works" of which (now
  called "The Newarke") the gathering was held.</p>

  <p>However venerable from its antiquity, it was, like too many of the
  sports of the Middle Ages, a custom "more honoured in the breach than the
  observance," and, as such, was put down in the year 1847 by a local act
  of parliament; not, however, without a serious affray between the police
  and the people.</p>

  <p><i>The Trial of Our Lord.</i>&mdash;I have lately seen an old picture
  of the Trial of Our Lord before Pilate, who sits in the midst of the
  Jewish Sanhedrim, each member of which has a scroll over his head, giving
  his name and the sentence he is said to have uttered on that occasion. I
  have been told there is a large coarse engraving of this picture
  sometimes to be found in cottages, but I have not been able to procure
  one. The names and sentiments are of course fictitious; is anything known
  of their origin?</p>

  <p class="author">P. P.</p>

  <p><i>Olney.</i>&mdash;Can any correspondent state what is the
  signification of this name? The ancient spelling is <i>Olnei</i> or
  <i>Olney</i>, not <i>Oulney</i>, as it has sometimes been spelled of late
  years. The difficulty is not as to the termination <i>ey</i>, but as to
  the first syllable.</p>

  <p>The parish church, which stands at the southern extremity of the town,
  on the banks of the Ouse, is entirely (modern alterations excepted) of
  the fourteenth century. There is not a trace of any earlier work.
  Tradition says that the church was formerly at the other, or northern end
  of the town, where there is a place which is, as I am informed, described
  in the deeds of some of the adjoining premises as the old churchyard,
  though it has been desecrated time out of mind. Closely adjacent is a
  clear spring, still called "Christenwell," and also the trunk of a very
  ancient elm. Human bones are stated to have been occasionally dug up
  within the enclosure.</p>

  <p>There is a vague tradition that the town as well as the church has
  been removed southward, <i>i. e.</i> nearer the river. Readers of "N.
  &amp; Q." who can supply any information respecting the removal of the
  church and town, or any other particulars (in addition to those contained
  in Dr. Lipscomb's <i>History of Bucks</i>) concerning the parish of
  Olney, including the hamlet and manor of Warrington, and the now district
  parish of Weston-Underwood, will greatly oblige</p>

  known among us as an <i>album</i>? Was it not first used by the learned
  men of Germany as a repository for the complimentary tributes of their
  foreign visitors? Is there any mention of it in any English author
  earlier than Izaak Walton, who tells us that Sir Henry Wotton, when
  ambassador at Venice, wrote in the <i>album</i> of Christopher Flecamore
  a Latin sentence to the effect that "an ambassador is an honest man, sent
  to lie abroad for the good of his country?" Where is the earliest

  give me some fuller information than is to be found in Lyttleton's
  <i>History of England</i>, or refer me to any authorities for such,
  concerning the family and connexions of the following personages?</p>

  <p>There was a Lady Lisle, who, temp. Jac. II., was tried at Winchester
  by the notorious Judge Jeffries, and afterwards executed, for harbouring
  two rebels after the battle of Sedgemoor. I believe she was beheaded as a
  favour, instead of being burnt. She was the widow of one of the judges
  who consented to the death of that ill-fated monarch Charles I.</p>

  <p>I observe the barony of Lisle has been extinct, or in abeyance, on
  four or five different occasions; was either about this time? The present
  peerage appears to have been created circa 1758. Are these descendants of
  that family?</p>

  <p>I possess portraits of Lord and Lady Lisle (size six feet by four),
  and much wish to learn the above, together with any other particulars
  relating to the family.</p>

  <p><i>Wards of the Crown.</i>&mdash;I find the origin of this ancient
  prerogative of royalty thus quaintly explained at p. 132. of King's
  <i>Vale Royall of England</i>, 1656. Hugh Lupus, first Norman Earl of
  Chester, and nephew of the Conqueror, at his death in 1101, left his
  son</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Richard, then an infant of seven years of age, entituled then to his
  Earldome of Chester, and <i>married</i> to Matilda, daughter to Stephen,
  Earl of Blois. And this Matilda was niece to King Henry I., by reason
  whereof the said king took into his tuition and custody the said young
  earl; from whence, they say, this of a custome grew to be a law, that
  young heirs in their nonage became pupils, or <i>wards</i>, unto the
  king. A very tender care had this king over this princely child, and
  brought him up in the company of his own children, with whom he sent him
  into Normandy, and with them there provided the most princely and best
  education for them."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Their after-history is well known. Having duly arrived at man's
  estate, these promising young princes and their companion, Richard, the
  royal ward, were sent for from Normandy by the affectionate king, whence,
  taking ship at Harfleur, they set sail for England; but, through some
  mismanagement, the vessel striking upon a rock, the entire company
  perished except one butcher, who, by the help of a mast, swam safe to
  land. This tragedy happened about December 7, 1120.</p>

  <p>I believe this to be the first instance recorded in English history of
  a ward to the king, but shall be happy to receive correction from any
  better-informed correspondent of "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p><i>Tate, an Artist.</i>&mdash;A friend of mine has a very fine family
  portrait, very much admired by judges, and generally ascribed to
  Reynolds, whose style it greatly resembles. But I believe it has with
  some confidence been stated to be the work of a pupil of Sir Joshua's,
  named Tate. The picture is about seventy years old. Would you, or any of
  your readers, kindly inform me whether an artist of that name lived at
  that time, and whether he was a pupil of Sir Joshua Reynolds?</p>

  <p><i>Philip d'Auvergne.</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On the 12th of March, 1792, the King of Great Britain granted to
  Captain Philip d'Auvergne, R. N., his licence to accept the succession to
  the said duchy (Bouillon), in case of the death of the hereditary prince,
  only son of the reigning duke, without issue male, pursuant to a
  declaration of his Serene Highness, dated June 25th, 1791, at the desire,
  and with the express and formal consent of the nation."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I find this in Brooke's <i>Gazetteer</i>, under the heading of
  "Bouillon." Can any of your correspondents give a further account of
  Captain d'Auvergne? I suppose the troubles consequent upon the French
  Revolution would prevent his accession to the duchy, even if he survived
  the hereditary prince?</p>

<h3>THE GOOKINS OF IRELAND.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. i., pp. 385. 473. 492.; Vol. ii., p. 44.; Vol. iv., p. 103.)</p>

  <p>Upon an examination of the ancient records which are preserved in the
  Exchequer Record Office, at the Four Courts, Dublin, it will be found
  that in the year 1632 Sir Vincent Gookin acquired, by purchase from David
  Earl of Barrymore, the lands of Cargane in the county of Cork; and from
  Mr. William Fitz John O'Hea, in the year 1633, the lands of
  Ballymacwilliam and Cruary, in the same county; and that he died on the
  7th of Feb. 1637<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>;&mdash;that Captain Robert Gookin,
  in recompence for his services as a soldier and adventurer, obtained an
  assignment from the Protector of an estate in the same county, consisting
  of upwards of five thousand acres, which he afterwards surrendered to
  Charles II.; and that thereupon the king granted it to Roger Earl of
  Orrery;&mdash;that Vincent Gookin died on the 29th of March, 1692, and
  that his son Robert, and Dorothy Clayton, were his executors;&mdash;that
  in the year 1681 the collectors of quit rent made a demand upon Thomas
  Gookin, one of Sir Vincent's sons, for the <!-- Page 239 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>{239}</span>rent of the lands which
  his father had purchased from Mr. O'Hea, and that, upon proof being made
  to the Court of Exchequer by Mr. John Burrowes, one of Sir Vincent's
  executors, that the estate was a "Protestant interest," or, in other
  words, that as the family had been of the Protestant religion, and not
  implicated in the rebellion of 1641, the lands were therefore not liable
  to the payment of quit rent, they were accordingly put out of charge. It
  appears also by the records which are deposited in the same office, that
  Thomas Gookin, gentleman, was indicted at the sessions held at Bandon in
  the year 1671, "for that he, with several others, riotously and
  unlawfully did assemble and associatt themselves together at Lislee, on
  the 27th of December, 1671, and in and uppon David Barry and Charles
  Carthy, gentlemen, did make a cruell assaulte and affray, and did beate,
  wound, and falsely imprison them, under colour of a warrant from Henry
  Bathurst, Esq., made and interlined by the said Thomas Gookin;" and that
  Elizabeth Gookin, of Lislee, spinster, was one of his sureties. This
  Elizabeth was probably descended from a Charles Gookin, who claimed the
  lands of Lislee in the time of the Protector. By the records in the same
  department, it appears that in and previous to the year 1719 a suit was
  pending in the Court of Exchequer with respect to the lands of
  Courtmacsherry; and by the Receiver's account, which bears the autograph
  of Robert Gookin, it is shown that a payment was made to Mrs. Dorothy
  Gookin for maintenance, and that there was an arrear due to Lady Mary
  Erwin, "at ye time of Captain Gookin's death, which happened in
  September, 1709:" and in the same office there is deposited a deed, dated
  the 30th of October, 1729, which relates to the lands of Clouncagh, in
  the same county of Cork, whereto John Allin, an alderman of the city of
  Cork, and Elizabeth Gookin, otherwise Towgood, his wife, and Robert
  Gookin, Esq., eldest son and devisee of Robert Gookin deceased, are
  parties. I have been informed that a lengthened account of Sir Vincent
  Gookin is to be found in Lord Stafford's State Letters; that much
  information may be gathered from the Privy Council Papers <i>tempore</i>
  Cromwell, which are deposited in Dublin Castle, with respect to Captain
  Robert Gookin; and that in the year 1620 Daniel Gookin was one of the
  undertakers in the county of Longford, and that his estate of five
  hundred acres afterwards passed to an ancestor of the late popular
  novelist Miss Edgeworth.</p>

  <p>Amongst the Inquisitions of the county of Cork which are preserved in
  the Rolls Office of Chancery, there is one which relates to Vincent
  Gookin, and was taken at Mallow, on the 14th of August, 1638; and is

<h3>"STABIT QUOCUNQUE JECERIS."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 65.)</p>

  <p>This little Query may perhaps come under the category you mention in
  the address of your opening Number for the year, although it might be a
  sufficient reply merely to say that it was the legend round the common
  Manx halfpenny, encircling the three legs of man on its reverse; but when
  we consider these three conjoined limbs in their awkward and impossible
  position, the propriety of the legend may be doubted, and its presence
  attributable only to the numismatic necessity of accompanying the figure
  with its motto. The following epigram has been composed by some Manxman
  thoroughly convinced of the propriety of the application:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Reader! thou'st seen a falling cat,</p>
      <p>Light always on his feet so pat;</p>
      <p>A shuttlecock will still descend,</p>
      <p>Meeting the ground with nether end;</p>
      <p>The persevering Manksman thus,</p>
      <p>A shuttlecock or pauvre puss;</p>
      <p>However through the world he's tost&mdash;</p>
      <p>However disappointed, crost&mdash;</p>
      <p>Reverses, losses, Fortune's frown,</p>
      <p>No chance or change can keep him down.</p>
      <p>Upset him any way you will,</p>
      <p>Upon his <i>legs</i> you'll find him still.</p>
      <p>For ever active, brisk, and spunky,</p>
      <p><i>Stabit jeceris quocunque</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Where, however, we perceive in the last line the rhyme has destroyed
  the metre of the Latin poet, if the words be really a classical
  quotation, which I should wish to form into a Query for some of your
  readers.</p>

  <p>But the emblem, as the famous <i>Triquetra</i>, is one of the most
  ancient and celebrated of antiquity. It figures on the oldest coins of
  Metapontum; and subsequently on many of those of Sicily, particularly on
  those of Palermo and Syracuse, as <i>island</i> cities; for to islands,
  from one use of its name in the Greek word <span title="CH√äL√ä" class="grk"
  >&Chi;&Eta;&Lambda;&Eta;</span>, as a jutting promontory, a break-water,
  or a jetty, was it more especially appropriated. Hence it is even now
  borne in the Neapolitan blazon for Sicily: as Britain, if she followed
  the continental examples, would be entitled to quarter it in her full
  imperial escutcheon, not only for Man, but for Malta; by which latter it
  was early taken as the device. But under this distinctive name as
  <i>Chele</i>, it only figured the potency which all pointed or angular
  forms and substances possessed insensitively or in a triple degree. To
  understand this, we should consider the force that all pointed or sharp
  instruments possess: the awl, the wedge, the adze, are well known for
  their assistance to the mechanic; and the transference of the idea to
  non-physical aid was so easy, and so consonant to the human mind, that,
  when we speak of the acuteness of an intellect, the point of an epigram,
  the keen edge of a sarcasm, we are scarcely conscious that we indulge at
  all in the maze of metaphor.</p>

  <p>Nor was the adaptation of the figure less suitable to the purposes of
  superstition, by which it <!-- Page 240 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page240"></a>{240}</span>was seized on, both for the purpose of
  driving away the evil one or forcing him to appear: all edged tools, or
  angular forms, gave complete mastery over him. Therefore, the best method
  of obtaining sight of the otherwise invisible spirits of the air, is by
  putting the head beneath the legs, the human fork or angle&mdash;the true
  Greek <i>chele</i>&mdash;as it is also used by Saxo-Grammaticus in a
  dialogue between Bearco and Ruta, to see Odin riding on the
  whirlwind:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>So boys in the north put their heads between their legs to see the
  devil looking over Lincoln: and I am indebted to a mention of my
  <i>Shakspeare's Puck and his Folk-lore</i> in the <i>Maidstone
  Journal</i> for the proof that this belief still exists in Ireland from
  an anecdote told by Curran, who, in the absence of a W√§hrwolf on which to
  try its efficacy, would prove it on a large mastiff by walking backwards
  to it in this posture, "while the animal made such a grip at the poor
  barrister's hinder region, that Curran was unable to <i>sit</i> with any
  gratification to himself for some weeks afterwards."</p>

  <p>Permit me to refer such readers as are curious to know more on this
  subject, to the above work, p. 73. But if you still can find room for a
  continental proof of the efficacy of a pair of shears as very powerful
  <i>chele</i>, not only for driving away Satan, but altogether banishing
  him from earth, allow me to adduce from a most excellent collection of
  tales, Traditions of the Bavarian Territories (<i>Sagenbuch der
  Baierischen Lande</i>), just published by Herr A. Sch√∂ppner, under the
  auspices of the ex-king, the following tale, No. 757, "Die Scharfe
  Scheere" (The Sharp Scissors):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Outside the parish church of M√ºnnerstadt, you see a gravestone with a
  pair of shears sculptured on it. He who rests under it was a pious
  tailor, who was often disturbed by the Devil in his devotions. The latter
  appeared to him frequently, and whispered him to throw plenty of cabbage
  into his hell (a technical German term for its receptacle, I know not if
  usual amongst the English gentle craft), and otherwise played him many
  insidious pranks. Our tired Schneider complained of the evil to a pious
  hermit, who advised him, the next time the Prince of Darkness made his
  appearance, to take the shears and <i>cut off his tail</i>. The tailor
  resolved to follow his advice; and, on the next visitation, he lopped the
  tail clean from his body. The Devil halloed out murder! went off, and
  ever afterwards left the tailor in peace. But the shears remained a long
  time as an heirloom in the family, and their form was sculptured on his
  tombstone in remembrance. Since then, the Devil walks through M√ºnnerstadt
  without a posterial adornment, and therefore not now recognisable; which
  is the reason that many people assert that there is no longer any
  Devil."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Picnics</i> were known and practised in the reign of James I. An
  amusing description of one is given in a letter from Sir Philip
  Mainwaring, dated Nov. 22, 1618. The knight is writing to Lord Arundel
  from Newmarket:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Prince his birth-day hathe beene solemnised heare by those few
  Marquises and Lords which found themselves heare, and to supplie the want
  of the Lords, Knights and Squires were admitted to a consultation,
  wherein it was resolved that such a number should meete at Gamiges, and
  bring every man his dish of meate. It was left to their own choyces what
  to bring: some strove to be substantiall, some curios, and some
  extravagant. Sir George Goring's invention bore away the bell; and that
  was foure huge brawny piggs, pipeing hott, bitted and harnised with ropes
  of sarsiges, all tyde to a monstrous bag-pudding."</p>

  <p>And on the 28th of the same month, Mr. Chamberlain wrote to Sir Dudley
  Carleton:</p>

  <p>"We hear nothing from Newmarket, but that they devise all the means

<h3>"CONINGER" OR "CONINGRY."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 182.)</p>

  <p>The Latin word for a rabbit is <i>cuniculus</i>, as is shown in the
  following couplet of Martial:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Gaudet in effossis habitare cuniculus antris:</p>
      <p class="i1">Monstravit tacitas hostibus ille vias."&mdash;xiii. 60.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The rabbit appears to have been originally peculiar to Spain, Southern
  France, and the adjoining islands. Strabo (iii. 2. ¬ß 6.) says that it is
  found nearly over the whole of Spain, and in the Balearic islands; and
  that it reaches as far as Massilia. Polybius (xii. 3.) likewise states it
  to be a native of Corsica. It was unknown to the Greeks, and is not
  mentioned by Aristotle in his works on natural history (see Camus,
  <i>Notes sur l'Histoire des Animaux d'Aristote</i>, p. 278.); nor does it
  ever occur in the √Üsopian fables, although the hare is frequently
  introduced. Hence it had no native Greek name; and Polybius borrows the
  Latin word, calling it <span title="kuniklos" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&#x1F7B;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  (compare <i>Athen.</i>, ix. p. 400.). Strabo uses the periphrasis of
  "burrowing hares," <span title="ge√¥ruchoi lagideis" class="grk"
  >&gamma;&epsilon;&#x1F7D;&rho;&upsilon;&chi;&omicron;&iota;
  &lambda;&alpha;&gamma;&iota;&delta;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&sigmaf;</span>.
  √Ülian, again, employs the Latin name, which he considers to be of Iberian
  origin (<i>De Nat. Anim.</i>, xiii. 15.). If this be true, the sense of
  <i>subterranean passage</i>, which <i>cuniculus</i> also bears, is
  secondary, and not primary (compare Plin. <i>Nat. Hist.</i>, viii.
  81.).</p>

  <p>The language of Varro <i>de Re Rust.</i> (iii. 12.) likewise shows
  that the rabbit was in his time peculiar to Spain, and had not been
  introduced into Italy. The meaning of the Hebrew word <i>Saphan</i>,
  which is translated <i>cony</i> in the authorised version of the Old
  Testament (Lev. xi. 5.; Deut. xiv. 7.; Ps. civ. 18.; Prov. xxx. 26.), has
  been fully investigated by biblical critics and naturalists. (See
  Bochart's <i>Hierozoicon</i>, vol. ii. pp. 409-429., ed. Rosenm√ºller;
  Winer, <i>Bibl. Real-W√∂rterbuch</i>, in <span
  class="sc">Springhase</span>; <i>Penny Cyclop√¶dia</i>, in <span
  class="sc">Hyrax</span>.) It is certainly <i>not</i> the rabbit, which is
  not a native of Syria and Palestine: but whether this ruminant quadruped,
  which lives in the rocks, is the jerboa, or a species of hyrax, or some
  other small edible animal of a like description, is difficult to
  determine.</p>

  <p>From the manner in which Strabo speaks of Spain and the Balearic
  islands being infested by large numbers of rabbits, it would appear (as
  Legrand d'Aussy remarks, <i>Vie priv√©e des Fran√ßais</i>, tom. ii. p. 24.)
  that the ancients did not eat its flesh. The rabbit is now so abundant in
  parts of the south of France, that, according to the same author, a
  sportsman in the islands near Arles who did not kill a hundred, would be
  dissatisfied with his day's sport. A Proven√ßal gentleman, who in 1551
  went out to kill rabbits with some of his vassals, and three dogs,
  brought home in the evening not less than six hundred.</p>

  <p>From the Latin <i>cuniculus</i> have been formed, according to the
  proper analogy, the Italian <i>coniglio</i>, the Spanish <i>con√©jo</i>,
  and the French <i>conil</i>, sometimes modified into <i>conin</i> (see
  Diez, <i>Roman. Gramm.</i>, vol. ii. p. 264.). From the old French
  <i>conin</i> was borrowed the English <i>coning</i> or <i>conig</i>,
  afterwards shortened into <i>cony</i>: and from this word have been
  formed <i>conigar</i> and <i>coningry</i> or <i>conigry</i>, for
  rabbit-warren (see Halliwell's <i>Dict.</i>, in <span
  class="sc">Conig</span>). <i>Conillus</i>, for a rabbit-warren, occurs in
  Ducange; <i>conej√°r</i> is the Spanish term.</p>

  <p>The Germans, like the English, had no native name for the rabbit; an
  animal not indigenous in their country. Hence they borrowed the French
  name <i>conin</i>, which they altered into <i>kanin</i>; and have since
  formed the diminutive <i>kaninchen</i>. In Suabian, the form used is
  <i>k√ºniglein</i>. See Adelung in v. The Dutch word is <i>kon√øn</i>.</p>

  <p>The rabbit was probably introduced into England from France. Query:
  When did that introduction take place? Also, when did the later term
  "rabbit" supersede the old name <i>cony</i>? and what is the etymology of
  <i>rabbit</i>? The French <i>lapin</i>, which has supplanted the old word
  <i>conin</i>, is said to be formed from <i>lepinus</i>, an adjective of
  <i>lepus</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">L.</p>

  <p>Your solution of the etymology of this word, as coming from
  <i>Coney</i><span class="nw">-borough,</span> is no doubt correct: but I
  apprehend the last syllable has a more specific derivation. On the
  opposite sides of the Lough of Belfast, there are two localities in which
  this old English word is preserved. This district was, as you are aware,
  colonised by English settlers about 1590 <span class="sm">A.D.</span>,
  when large grants were made to Sir Arthur Chichester, ancestor of the
  present Marquis of Donegal. At Carrickfergus, on the north side of the
  bay, there is a spot called the <i>Connyberry</i>, which is a corruption
  of "Coneyborough;" but on the opposite side, at Holyward, there is a
  populous rabbit-warren, known as the "Kinnegar;" which I take to be the
  <i>conynger</i> or <i>coningeria</i> about which your correspondent
  asks.</p>

<h3>NAMES AND NUMBERS OF BRITISH REGIMENTS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 155.)</p>

  <p>Z.'s <i>third</i> application relative to the names and numbers of
  regiments has roused me into activity, <!-- Page 242 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>{242}</span>and I now forward you
  the required information, viz.:</p>

  <p>Query 1. What was the origin of giving British regiments the name of
  certain officers, instead of numbering them as at present?</p>

  <p>Regiments were numbered, but it was generally customary to designate
  them by the name of their colonel previous to 1751.</p>

  <p>2. If in honour of an officer commanding the corps, was the name
  changed when that officer died or removed to another regiment, or what
  was the rule?</p>

  <p>The name of the regiment changed by death or removal of the
  colonel.</p>

  <p>3. When did the present mode of numbering regiments begin, and by whom
  was it introduced?</p>

  <p>1st July, 1751, by royal warrant of George II., when the number of the
  regiment was directed to be embroidered on its standard; even after the
  numbering became general, the names of colonels were for some time
  retained.</p>

  <p>4. What was the rule or principle laid down in giving any regiment a
  certain number? Was it according to the length of time it had been
  embodied?</p>

  <p>In 1694 a board of officers assembled to decide the relative rank of
  regiments, and the regiments formed in England were placed by seniority
  of raising, but those from Scotland or Ireland on their being placed upon
  the English establishment.</p>

  <p>5. What is the guide now in identifying a named with a numbered
  regiment; for example, at the battle of Culloden in 1746, Wolfe's,
  Barrett's, and Howard's Foot were engaged. Now, what is the rule for
  ascertaining the numbers of these and other old regiments in the British
  army at the present day?</p>

  <p>The Army List with colonels of that date. In 1746 Wolfe's was the 8th
  Foot, Barrett's the 4th Foot, and Howard's the 3rd Foot. There were two
  Howards of the same date (1746), Green and the Buff Howards, known by
  their facings.</p>

<h3>VICARS-APOSTOLIC IN ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vi., pp. 125. 297. 400.)</p>

  <p>I send the following as some answer to the inquiries made by your
  correspondent A. S. A. For the more ample account of Bishop Ellis, I am
  indebted to an article in the <i>Rambler</i>, vol. vii. p. 313., entitled
  "Collections illustrating the History of the English Benedictine
  Congregation."</p>

  <p>Richard Smith, appointed Bishop of Chalcis, Feb. 4, 1625, and
  Vicar-Apostolic of England; he withdrew to France four years afterwards,
  and died in Paris in 1655, aged eighty-eight, in a house belonging to the
  English convent upon the Foss√© St. Victor. He was probably buried in the
  convent chapel, where a monument to his memory was erected. See the Rev.
  Joseph Berington's <i>Memoirs of Panzani</i>, p. 109.</p>

  <p>John Leyburn, consecrated Bishop of Adrumetum, and appointed
  Vicar-Apostolic of England, 1685: on the country being divided into four
  vicariats in 1688, he was appointed to the London, or southern district.
  On the breaking out of the revolution in the same year, he was committed
  to the Tower; but his peaceable and inoffensive conduct soon caused him
  to be discharged, and he was suffered to remain unmolested until his
  death, which occurred in 1703. He was greatly beloved and respected by
  his flock.</p>

  <p>Bonaventure Giffard, of the ancient Roman Catholic family of the
  Giffards of Chillington, Staffordshire, appointed Vicar-Apostolic of the
  Midland District, 1688. Like Bishop Leyburn, on the breaking out of the
  revolution, he was committed to the Tower, but was soon released, and on
  the condition of always making the place of his abode known to the
  government, he passed the remainder of his days unmolested. On the death
  of Bishop Leyburn in 1703, he was removed to the London, or southern
  district, where he died March 12, 1734, aged ninety. There is a good
  portrait of Bishop Giffard at the Roman Catholic College of Old Hall
  Green in Hertfordshire.</p>

  <p>Philip Ellis, third son of Rev. John Ellis, Rector of Waddesden,
  Bucks, by his wife Susanna Welbore, whilst a pupil in Westminster School,
  was called to the Catholic faith, and to the grace of religion, in St.
  Gregory's Convent, Douay, where he made his profession, 30th November,
  1670, √¶t. eighteen. After duly qualifying himself for the ministry, he
  was sent to labour in the English vineyard. His great abilities
  recommended him to the notice of King James II., who appointed him one of
  his chaplains and preachers; and when Innocent XI., on 30th January,
  1688, signified his wish that his majesty would nominate three fit
  subjects to fill the newly constituted vicariats, midland, northern, and
  western (for Dr. John Leyburn, Bishop of Adrumetum, during the last three
  years had governed the whole of England), Father Ellis, then thirty-six
  years of age, was selected for the western vicariat, and was consecrated
  bishop on Sunday, 6th May, 1688, at St. James's, where the king had
  established a convent of fourteen Benedictine monks, by the title of
  Aureliopolis. In the second week of July, the new prelate confirmed a
  considerable number of youths, some of them recent converts, in the new
  chapel of the Savoy. (<i>Ellis Correspondence</i>, vol. ii. p. 62.) In
  his letter (ibid. p. 145.) to his brother John, dated from St. James's,
  26th August, 1688, he describes the uneasiness of the court at the
  preparations making in Holland by the Prince of <!-- Page 243 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>{243}</span>Orange. We doubt if
  this vicar-apostolic attempted to visit his diocese; for, on the breaking
  out of the revolution at London in the ensuing November, he was
  apprehended and committed to Newgate (Macaulay's <i>History</i>, vol. ii.
  p. 563.), yet he was soon restored to liberty. Foreseeing but faint hope
  of serving the cause of religion in such turbulent times, he left England
  for the court of his exiled sovereign at St. Germains, and, after staying
  some time, obtained permission to visit the Eternal City. In 1693 Pope
  Innocent XII. made him an assistant prelate; and on the feast of St.
  Louis, six years later, he sung the high mass at Rome, in the French
  church, before many cardinals, invited and received by the Cardinal de
  Bouillon. The Prince of Monacho, ambassador of France, being then
  incognito, assisted in a tribune. Resigning his western vicariat, he was
  promoted by Pope Clement XI. to the vacant see of Segni, in the Campagna
  di Roma. There he originated a seminary, over which he watched with
  parental zeal and solicitude. In November 1710, he held a synod in the
  choir of his cathedral; about seventy of his clergy attended, all of whom
  he entertained with generous hospitality. In addition to his many
  meritorious works, he substantially repaired and embellished his palace,
  and to his cathedral he left a splendid mitre and some costly vestments;
  but the bulk of his property he bequeathed to his seminary. A dropsy of
  the chest carried him off on the 16th November, 1726, √¶t. seventy-four,
  and his remains were interred in the centre of the seminary church.</p>

  <p>Seven sermons of this prelate, preached before James II. at Windsor
  and St. James's, were printed.</p>

  <p>A beautiful portrait of the Bishop, engraved by Meyer, is prefixed to

  <p>James Smith was consecrated Bishop of Calliopolis, and appointed
  Vicar-Apostolic of the Northern District, 1688: he died May 20, 1711.</p>

  <p>The following Vicars-Apostolic were nominated after the above four
  till the year 1750.</p>

  <p><i>Midland District.</i>&mdash;George Witham, of the ancient Roman
  Catholic family of the Withams of Cliffe, in the North Riding of
  Yorkshire, was educated at Douay College, consecrated Bishop of
  Marcopolis, and appointed Vicar-Apostolic of the Midland District in
  1703. He was removed to the Northern District in 1716, and died in 1725,
  at Cliffe Hall, the seat of his family.</p>

  <p><i>Western District.</i>&mdash;Matthew Pritchard, a Franciscan Friar,
  Bishop of Myrinen: I have not been able to ascertain the date either of
  his consecration or death; the latter took place at Perthyre,
  Monmouthshire.<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p><i>Northern District.</i>&mdash;Thomas Williams, a Dominican friar,
  Bishop of Tiberiopolis, died at Huddlestone, Yorkshire, April 14,
  1740.</p>

  <p>I have since learned Bishop Pritchard was consecrated in 1715.</p>

</div>
  <p>The reply of E. H. A. to my Query about these Vicars-Apostolic is
  rather unsatisfactory. I admit his correction of <i>Chalcedon</i> for
  <i>Chalcis</i>, but wish that he had been more explicit in his notices of
  both those Vicars-Apostolic appointed in 1685-88, as well as of those
  since nominated. When did <i>Smith</i> and <i>Ellis</i> die? and what was
  the see in Italy to which the latter was nominated? Who were the
  <i>consecrators</i> of Giffard, Ellis, and Smith? Bishop Leyburn was, I
  think, one, and is said to have been "assisted by two <i>Irish</i>
  prelates." Who were they? E. H. A. also refers, as his authority, to a
  tract by the Rev. L. Darwall, in <i>Christian's Miscellany</i>: but he
  does not give the date of that publication, nor did I ever hear of it.
  Surely some ecclesiastical reader of "N. &amp; Q." will answer some, at
  least, of these inquiries of mine. I know many of your subscribers can do
  so if they choose. I am desirous of possessing the names and dates of
  consecration and death of every Roman Catholic Vicar-Apostolic appointed
  for England since 1689, and also of those for Scotland, if possible.</p>

<h3>SMOCK MARRIAGES.&mdash;SCOTCH LAW OF MARRIAGE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. vii., p. 191.)</p>

  <p>To a certain extent, the information <span class="sc">Mr. F. H.
  Brett</span> got from his Scotch friend is correct. An idea does exist in
  some parts of Scotland, that children born out of wedlock must be "under
  the apron string" at the solemnisation of the marriage of their parents,
  before they can be legitimated <i>per subsequens matrimonium</i>. How
  this notion originated, I do not pretend to say; but it is easy to
  speculate as to its origin. But <span class="sc">Mr. Brett's</span>
  friend showed a blessed ignorance of the laws of his native country, if
  he ever said that "in the Scotch law of marriage there is a clause
  providing that all 'under the apron string,' at the time of the marriage,
  shall be considered legitimate." The Scotch law of marriage is not
  statutory, and, consequently, it has no clauses.</p>

  <p>I have often felt sore at the ignorance displayed, even in
  well-informed circles in England, as to the real principles of the Scotch
  law of marriage; and I am encouraged by the comprehensive terms of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Brett's</span> Query, to hope that you will permit me to
  say a word or two which may serve to dissipate some of the delusions that
  prevail as to both the constitution of a Scotch marriage, and its
  effects.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, as in every country whose system of jurisprudence is
  based on the civil law, <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page244"></a>{244}</span>marriage is dealt with as <i>a purely
  civil contract</i>; and its constitution may be established by the same
  proof as would establish any ordinary civil contract, viz. by writing, by
  the testimony of witnesses, or by the judicial confession of the parties.
  It is true, that, in deference to the natural feeling that the blessing
  of God should be invoked upon the constitution of a relation so important
  and so solemn, and from other considerations of public policy and
  morality, the law has prescribed that a "regular marriage" can be
  performed only by a clergyman, after due proclamation of the banns; and
  that it punishes an "irregular" constitution of the contract by fines and
  other penalties. But it never loses sight of the principle, that the
  contract is purely civil; and irregularity in point of <i>form</i>,
  though punishable, does not vitiate the contract, which is binding and
  valid if its <i>substance</i> be proved, in the same way as any other
  contract may be proved. Such a contract is binding, if entered into in
  accordance with the <i>lex loci contractus</i>, although that law should
  differ from the law of the domicile of the parties. The sole privilege of
  the smith of Gretna Green consisted in his smithy being the nearest place
  to the English border, at which witnesses to the constitution of the
  contract could be obtained. Now-a-days, I suppose, a runaway couple,
  unable to hire a special train, would take the express; and I would
  advise them to take their tickets to Ecclefechan&mdash;the first Scotch
  station at which the express stops&mdash;and to confer on the
  station-master and porter there the dignity of high priests of Hymen: for
  they, or any other two witnesses you meet in Scotland, can help you to
  tie the knot as firmly as the Gretna smith. After what I have said, I
  need hardly add that these functionaries had no warrant for their
  certificate that their marriages were performed "according to the forms
  of the Church of Scotland." To those who look upon marriage as a purely
  civil contract, the mock ceremony at Gretna is a marriage; to those who
  look upon it as a sacrament, or who think that a religious ceremony
  affects its constitution in the slightest degree, a Gretna Green marriage
  is, in plain words, neither more nor less than a <i>legalised
  concubinage</i>; and, surely, I need not say, that the spouses in such a
  marriage, though, <i>quoad omnem civilem effectum</i>, on the same
  footing with persons regularly married <i>in facie ecclesi√¶</i>, are
  not&mdash;in Scotland, at least&mdash;allowed to obtrude themselves into
  respectable society. So much for the constitution of the contract of
  marriage under the law of Scotland.</p>

  <p>As for its effects, in so far as involved in <span class="sc">Mr.
  Brett's</span> Query, no such provision exists, or ever did exist, in the
  Scotch law of marriage, as that children, to be legitimatised <i>per
  subsequens matrimonium</i>, must be under their mother's apron strings.
  In its effects, as well as in its constitution, the contract of marriage
  in Scotland is ruled by the principles of the civil law; and <i>all</i>
  the children of the spouses, born before marriage, are legitimated <i>per
  subsequens matrimonium</i>, whether, at the time the ceremony is
  performed, they be "under the apron strings" or not. The old theory was,
  that marriage being a consensual contract, the constitution of the rights
  and obligations arising from it drew back to the date of the consent;
  which, in the case of parties who had previously had connexion, was
  presumed in law to be the date of the connexion. This theory has of late
  been somewhat impaired by the decision of the Court of Session, in the
  case of Kerr <i>v.</i> Martin. See Dunlop Bell and Murray's <i>Reports of
  Cases decided in the Court of Session</i>, vol. ii. p. 752. The soundness
  of that decision is still matter of controversy in the profession; but I
  may refer <span class="sc">Mr. Brett</span> to it as containing a full
  and able discussion of the whole principles on which the Scotch law of
  marriage is founded.</p>

  <p>I remember that my brother, when curate of a parish in Lincolnshire
  between 1838 and 1844, married a woman enveloped only in a sheet. He was
  of course startled at the slenderness of her apparel; but as all the
  requisitions of the law had been complied with, he did not feel himself
  at liberty to refuse. He contented himself, therefore, with addressing
  the numerous congregation on the behaviour he expected from them at a
  religious ordinance, and all went off well. The reason for the bride so
  presenting herself, was of course the popular opinion, that her new
  husband would not be liable for her debts.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC NOTES AND QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Mr. Weld Taylor's Process.</i>&mdash;As I presume the object of
  publishing Photographic Notes, &amp;c., is to aid those who are <i>not
  proficients</i> in the processes indicated, <span class="sc">Mr. Weld
  Taylor</span> must not take umbrage at his first communication being
  misunderstood, whether unavoidably or wilfully, as I am sure the former
  must have been the case with all novices in the photographic art at
  least; however, I had no intention whatever of offering any annoyance to
  <span class="sc">Mr. Taylor</span> in my remarks, which were intended
  solely with a view to produce an effect which has partially been
  successful, that of exciting a more definite explanation of his meaning.
  That <span class="sc">Mr. Weld Taylor</span> may "enlighten" me is not
  only possible, but very probable, and I can only say I shall be much
  obliged to him for so doing.</p>

  <p>With reference to his process for iodizing Canson's paper, I presume
  his meaning to be as follows, viz.: Mix half an ounce of a
  <i>forty-grain</i> solution of <i>nitrate of silver</i> with an equal
  quantity <!-- Page 245 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page245"></a>{245}</span>of a <i>fifty-grain</i> solution of
  <i>iodide of potassium</i>, by which a precipitate of iodide of silver
  will be formed, the supernatant fluid containing the excess of iodide of
  potassium and the nitrate of potash formed by the decomposition.
  <i>Add</i> drop by drop a solution of the cyanide of potassium, until the
  iodide of silver is redissolved, and the liquid becomes limpid, and then
  <i>four ounces</i> more of distilled water, making up five ounces
  altogether. The paper should then be washed over with the above and
  <i>dried</i>, after which it may be floated on water slightly acidulated
  with sulphuric acid for a few minutes, and after being again dried,
  either wholly, or else partially with blotting-paper, may be rendered
  sensitive with a weak solution of nitrate of silver. Here are two or
  three points admitting doubt: first, Would it not be better to wash away
  the nitrate of potash and free iodide of potash first, and then dissolve
  the iodide of silver in solution of cyanide of potassium? Secondly, Would
  not a slight soaking in plain water after the acidulated bath be of
  advantage? Thirdly, Is it better to dry the paper again before rendering
  it sensitive? and fourthly, What strength of nitrate of silver solution
  should be used to render it sensitive; and ought it to have any acetic or
  gallic acid, or both?</p>

  <p><i>Animal Charcoal in Photography.</i>&mdash;Perhaps you or one of
  your photographic correspondents would inform me whether the animal
  charcoal, recommended for the aceto-nitrate of silver solution, should be
  used as a filter, or simply allowed to remain in the bottom of the
  bottle?</p>

  <p><i>Sir W. Newton on Use of Common Soda and Alum.</i>&mdash;In reply to
  <span class="sc">W. Adrian Delferier</span>, who is desirous of knowing
  the "<i>rationale</i> of the <i>action</i> of the <i>common soda</i> and
  powdered alum, &amp;c.," my motive for using <i>common soda</i> to
  cleanse the <i>negatives</i> is, that it not only removes the
  hyposulphite of soda more readily, but any impurities which may be in the
  paper, as well as the <i>whole</i> of the <i>size</i>, such being
  absolutely necessary for the after <i>waxing</i> process; which, when
  done, the negative should appear nearly as transparent as glass.</p>

  <p>The reason why I prefer <i>alum</i> for the positives is, that while
  it has the effect of removing the hyposulphite of soda and other
  impurities in the paper, it does not act upon the <i>size</i>, which in
  this instance it is desirous to retain.</p>

  <p>I have been induced to make a series of experiments, with a view to
  prevent the <i>fading</i> of the <i>positives</i>, or, indeed, that any
  portion should be, as it were, <i>eaten away in parts</i>; and since I
  have adopted the foregoing, in no one instance has any change taken place
  whatever.</p>

  <p><i>Difficulties in Photographic Practice.</i>&mdash;Having met with
  some of the difficulties that your correspondent G. H. mentions in his
  communication (Vol. vii., p. 218.), I beg to offer a few hints which I
  think will be of service to those who are trying the waxed-paper
  process.</p>

  <p>With regard to the spots, it is not easy to know whether they are
  produced by particles of iron in the paper, or by the oxide of silver. Le
  Gray says: "If spots should form, produced by the oxide of silver, they
  may be removed by pouring over the negative some acetic acid, and passing
  a brush lightly over it."</p>

  <p>The second difficulty, want of depth of tone or intensity in the
  negative, may have been caused by too short an exposure in the camera, or
  not having used the proper proportion of developing solution. Try the
  following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>4 oz. dist. water.</p>
      <p>8 grains gallic acid.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>When this solution has been filtered, add to it ¬Ω drachm of the
  aceto-nitr. of silver solution, and 1 drachm of acetic acid. I have
  generally put a little camphor in the gallic acid solution, as
  recommended by Laborde. It prevents the decomposition of the gallic acid,
  and renders the image clearer and free from spots. A piece about the size
  of a pea for four or five ounces of solution.</p>

  <p>As to the third difficulty, I believe nothing but replacing the
  porcelain dishes by glass ones will prevent the dirty marbled appearance
  in the bottom of the dishes made of porcelain; they are generally rough
  and uneven on the surface, and there are often what is called
  "kiln-cracks" in the angular parts. Two months ago I bought two glass
  dishes; although they are more than double the price of porcelain, I
  expect the annoyance of dirty dishes is prevented. The glass ones are
  made quite round at the sides and ends, and of course will be easily
  cleaned. I am informed they are made in France, but they could be had of
  English manufacture.</p>

  <p>The animal charcoal in the sensitive solution must be shaken up in the
  aceto-nitrate solution; and when it has become quite clear, the solution
  before using must be filtered into the dish.</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>The Countess of Pembroke's Letter</i> (Vol. i., pp. 28. 119. 154.;
  Vol. vii., p. 154.).&mdash;None of your correspondents seem to be aware
  that the paper in the <i>World</i> (No. XIV. April 5, 1753), in which
  this questioned letter first appeared, was written by Horace Walpole, and
  was afterwards reproduced by him in his <i>Royal and Noble Authors</i>.
  These facts may help to guide inquirers, <!-- Page 246 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>{246}</span>but they seem to me not
  to testify much for the authenticity of the piece. This, among many
  publications in the <i>World</i>, would certainly prove nothing; but
  Walpole's venturing to reproduce it in an acknowledged work to which he
  attached considerable importance, is no doubt of some weight.</p>

  heads of Ancient Britons, Saxons, Danes, and other races, to be referred
  to as standards or examples of the respective crania of those people?" I
  beg to say that beneath the chancel of the church of St. Leonard, Hythe,
  there is a crypt containing a vast number of skulls and other human

  are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Supposed by some to be gathered at the shore after a great sea-fight

  their bones, after the consumption of the flesh, might be cast up there,
  and so gathered and reserved for memorandum."</p>

  <p>Speaking of these relics, Walker, in his <i>Physiology</i>, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These skulls at Hythe are not of one race, either Saxon or British,

  predominate: one, a long narrow skull, greatly resembling the Celtic of

  Gothic.... Another kind of skulls, fewer in number, are evidently Roman
  skulls."</p>

  <p><i>Drake the Artist</i> (Vol. vi., p. 555.).&mdash;Searching a series

  1780, I find that Mr. Drake at York, F.S.A. (Fellow of that Society), in
  1773 exhibited at their New Room, near Exeter Change in the
  Strand,&mdash;</p>

  <p>No. 89. "A Family <span class="sm">IN LITTLE</span>."</p>

  <p>Is this to be interpreted by Hamlet's sarcasm upon the sycophants of
  his uncle's court, who paid "Forty, fifty, nay, one hundred ducats, for
  his portrait <i>in little</i>?" Small full-lengths were in vogue at the
  period, but our Yorkist has a delicate diminutive of his own. Again, in
  1775, we have three works of Drake&mdash;</p>

  <p>72. "View of a Gentleman's Seat in Yorkshire, with two Gentlemen going
  out a-hawking."</p>

  <i>Seasons</i>, 4to. edition, 1730.</p>

  <p>74. "A Winter Piece."</p>

  <p>And in 1776:</p>

  <p>23. "A Madonna and Child." Mr Drake, F.S.A., York.</p>

  <p>There is <i>no</i> trace of him at the Royal Academy. Thus we have him
  in portraiture, in landscape, in sacred history, and in the poetical
  imaginative. This is beyond what G. reckons upon; and now, having
  contributed thus much, I hope some of your readers may assist in carrying
  the inquiry further.</p>

  <p><i>Sparse</i> (Vol. vi., p. 554.; Vol. vii., p. 51.), said to be an
  Americanism.&mdash;I have in my possession an edition, printed in 1611,
  of the <i>Whole Book of Psalms, collected into English Metre</i>, by
  Thomas Sternhold, John Hopkins, and others. In the paraphrase of Psalm
  xliv. v. 10. is the following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Thou madest us fly before our foes,</p>

      <p class="i1">When we were <i>sparst</i> abroad."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The word here used in 1611 was evidently no American one; and yet it
  is singular that neither Bailey (1740), Johnson (1755), or Barclay
  (1800), have the word in their dictionaries; but Knowles (1835) and
  Blackie's <i>Imperial</i> (1850) both mentioned it; and have
  <i>sparse</i>, <i>sparsed</i>, <i>sparsedly</i>, and <i>sparsing</i>, all

  <p><i>Segantiorum Portus</i> (Vol. vii., p. 180.).&mdash;I know not what
  <span class="sc">Prestoniensis</span> means by Ptolemy's <i>History of

  is called, in the <i>Palatine MS.</i>, <i>Segantiorum Portus</i>, or
  <i>Setantiorum Portus</i> in Berthius's great edition of Ptolemy's
  <i>Geography</i>, ch. iii., tit. Albion, tab. 1.</p>

  <p>It is curious that the place <i>immediately</i> preceding in Ptolemy's
  <i>Catalogue</i> that inquired about, affords, in the vast multitude
  enumerated in that work, the closest approach to identity between the
  ancient and modern names, viz. <span title="Morikamb√™ Eischusis" class="grk"

  <i>Morecambe Bay</i>, in which Ulverston is the chief town, so that of
  this point there can be no doubt. Then comes <i>Setantiorum Portus</i>,
  of which Montanus, Bertius, and subsequent geographers give
  <i>Winandermere</i> as the modern name, meaning of course the mouth of
  the river through which Lake Windermere discharges itself into Morecambe
  Bay. But I doubt this, for there is no town of Windermere, nor indeed any
  other, that Ptolemy could have called a harbour (<i>portus</i>), till we
  come to Lancaster, which I therefore incline to believe was the <i>Portus
  Setantiorum</i>. After this <i>portus</i> comes <i>Belisama
  √Üstuarium</i>, by which all interpreters understand the mouth of the
  Ribble, which is probably the point that interests <span
  class="sc">Prestoniensis</span>, as Preston stands on that river. The
  conjecture that Lancaster was the <i>Portus Setantiorum</i> is
  corroborated by the latitudes and longitudes given by Ptolemy, which,
  though not to be absolutely relied on, are not to be disregarded, and
  which give to the three places, <i>Morecambe √Üstuarium</i>,
  <i>Setantiorum Portus</i>, and <i>Belisama √Üstuarium</i>, nearly the
  relative positions in which we find Ulverston, Lancaster, and the
  Ribble.</p>

  <p><i>Rubrical Query</i> (Vol. vi., p. 509.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Qu√¶stor</span> inquires the meaning of the words "if occasion
  lie" in the Rubric immediately before the Offertory in the Communion
  Service. I am under the impression that "if occasion lie" here simply
  means, <i>in case there is necessity to do so</i>; and for the origin of
  this parenthetical clause I would refer to the Rubric of 1549 (Keeling,
  <i>Lit. Br.</i>, edit. of 1842, p. 178.), which provides:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That in cathedral churches, or places where there is daily communion,
  it shall be sufficient to read this exhortation once in a month, and in
  parish churches on the week days it may be left unsaid."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Showing clearly the mode in which the exhortation was intended to be
  used. The real difficulty, however, is not noticed by your querist, which
  is, as to when "Public warning of the Communion" is to be given. One
  Rubric says that this notice is to be given "immediately after the Nicene
  Creed;" another prescribes that when this warning is to be given, it
  shall be done "immediately after sermon." On this point see Sharpe on
  <i>Rubrics</i>, p. 62.; and Wheatly on <i>Common Prayer</i>, chap. vi.

  confidently asserted that Vandyke never painted in enamel; the enamels
  referred to were at best only "after Vandyke." Nothing more frequent, in
  both earlier and present times, than the copying large oil portraits in

  <p><i>The Word "Party"</i> (Vol. vii., p. 177.).&mdash;I can furnish a
  more ancient example of the use of this word than the one given by your
  correspondent.</p>

  <p>In an old MS. "Booke of Recepts," in my possession, of the year
  1681-2, there occurs the following singular prescription:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>The Powder of Buggs.</i>&mdash;Take the buggs and wash them well
  in white wine, and putt them in a new earthen pott, and set them in an
  oven till they be dry enough for powder; then beat them, and sift them,
  and give ye party as much as will lye upon a groate every morning in
  honey."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Can any one inform me for what disease this nauseous remedy was
  prescribed, and whether it be now excluded from the pharmacop&oelig;ia?
  Perhaps this oleaginous insect was formerly exhibited in those cases for
  which cod liver oil is now so extensively used.</p>

  <p class="author">G.</p>

  <p>Your correspondent E. D. might have gone much farther back for an
  example of the use of the word <i>party</i> for a particular person. In
  the <i>Tempest</i>, Act III. Sc. 2., we have:</p>

    <div class="stanza">

  down in drops. Any person walking in a meadow on which the sun is shining
  powerfully, where the grass has not long previously been refreshed by
  rain, may observe a tremulous motion in distant objects, occasioned by
  the rising of the watery vapour; exactly resembling that which takes

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The remarkable collection of Northern Irish Antiquities and Historical
  Relics, exhibited at Belfast on the occasion of the British Association
  meeting in that city, has led to the publication of <i>The Ulster Journal
  of Arch√¶ology</i>, which is to be conducted by gentlemen of the province,
  and principally devoted to the elucidation of the antiquities and ancient
  history of Ulster. Ulster, it will be remembered, is historically
  remarkable as being the last part of Ireland which held out against the
  English sway, and which therefore retained its ancient customs until a
  comparatively recent period. Ulster was also the battle-field of the
  ancient native Irish chieftains and the Scandinavian Vikings. The
  antiquaries of Ulster have therefore done wisely, while the tangled web
  of Northern Irish History can yet be <!-- Page 249 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>{249}</span>unravelled by existing
  aids&mdash;while the men who are now the depositories of family and local
  history are yet among them&mdash;to commence this Journal; and in the
  tact and good management displayed in the selection of the materials of
  their opening Number, they have not only done wisely, but done well also.
  May they go on and prosper!</p>

  <p>At a moment when all eyes are looking anxiously for the new volume of
  Nineveh Discoveries, we have received a work of kindred character and of
  very high value. It is entitled <i>Lares and Penates, or Cilicia and its
  Governors; being a short historical account of that province from the
  earliest times to the present day, together with a description of some
  Household Gods of the Ancient Cilicians, broken up by them on their
  conversion to Christianity, first discovered and brought to this country
  by the author</i>, W. B. Barker, edited by W. F. Ainsworth; and the
  interest which this title naturally excites is fully maintained upon a
  perusal of the work. Although, by readers who care little for its
  arch√¶ological features, the work will be read with the highest
  satisfaction, it is one which will afford to the antiquary information of
  the greatest importance; while to many, the announcement that the
  remarkable monuments of the ancient Cilicians, so happily discovered by
  Mr. Barker, were discovered by him in the city dignified by the birth of
  the great apostle of the Gentiles,&mdash;and that the mutilation of these
  works of art, once the objects of religious regard, was probably the
  consequence of the missionary visit of Paul and Silas to
  Tarsus,&mdash;will probably be the strongest recommendation which this
  work could receive.</p>

  <p>We have received three Catalogues which call for such mention as
  should direct to them the attention of our bibliographical friends. One
  is of the splendid Library of Mr. Dawson Turner, which will occupy
  Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson for thirteen days in its disposal. The
  next, <i>Bibliotheca Americana</i>, is of a most remarkable collection of
  American Books on sale by Mr. Russell Smith. The third is of an extensive
  collection of Theological Works on sale by Mr. Straker. The last two are
  made more valuable by the addition of useful indices.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Books Received.</span>&mdash;<i>A Manual of
  Photography</i>, by Robert Hunt, <i>Third Edition enlarged</i>. It is
  sufficient to say that Professor Hunt's volume is at once the most
  elaborate, as his acquirements will ensure its being one of the most
  scientific works extant upon this now popular subject.&mdash;<i>Memoirs
  of a Ma√Ætre d'Armes, or Eighteen Months at St. Petersburgh, by</i> A.
  Dumas; <i>translated by</i> The Marquis of Ormonde, is one of the most
  amusing and graphic among the many amusing and graphic volumes which have
  already appeared in the <i>Traveller's Library</i>.&mdash;<i>Cyclop√¶dia
  Bibliographica.</i> Part VI. Mr. Darling's useful Cyclop√¶dia maintains
  its character.&mdash;<i>The Fall of Jerusalem</i>, by the Rev. Dr.
  Milman. This endeavour to direct the public mind, through the medium of
  this dramatic poem, to the striking and incontestable evidence of the
  full completion of Prophecy in the Fall of Jerusalem, is a valuable
  addition to Murray's <i>Railway Reading</i>.&mdash;We must here
  acknowledge the receipt of two other volumes of poetry: <i>Beauty, a
  Poem</i>, by the author of <i>Silent Love</i>, an admirer and not
  unsuccessful imitator of Pope; and <i>Love in the Moon</i>, by Patrick
  Scott, a work in which scientific observation is combined with great
  poetic feeling and considerable power.&mdash;<i>The Pilgrim's Progress of
  John Bunyan, for the Use of Children in the English Church, edited by the
  Rev. J. M. Neale</i>. The object with which this beautiful edition has
  been prepared is so plainly stated, that we need only wish the book as
  wide a circulation as it deserves.&mdash;<i>The Family Shakspeare</i>,
  &amp;c., by Thomas Bowdler. The fourth volume of this reprint of Mr.
  Bowdler's carefully revised edition of Shakspeare, contains the three
  Parts of Henry VI., Richard III., Henry VIII., and Timon of Athens.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"He (Dr. B.) has caught his tone and treatment from the ingenious and
  industrious scholars of that part of the Continent. There is no
  speculation too refined, no analogy too subtle and remote, for the
  employment of their time and talents; and in much that Dr. Bell advances
  on the same system to establish the intimate connexion between the
  Northern mythology and some of the popular superstitions of these
  islands, we concur.... At times, when we were most disposed to ridicule
  his positions, his learning stepped forward to his aid; and if it did not
  secure for him all our patience, at all events it commanded much of our
  respect."&mdash;<i>Athen√¶um, Oct. 2.</i></p>

  <p>"Dr. Bell, whose long residence in Germany, and intimate acquaintance
  with the popular literature of that country, entitles him to speak with
  great authority upon all questions relating to the Mythology of the
  Teutonic race, has just published a little volume, which will be read
  with interest by all who, to use the words of Mr. Keightly, 'have a taste
  for the light kind of philosophy' to be found in this subject.... Dr.
  Bell has displayed in the work before us an amount of original
  investigation so much beyond what is generally found among recent writers
  upon Folk-lore, that he can well afford to have this slight omission
  pointed out."&mdash;<i>Notes and Queries. Oct. 2.</i></p>

  <p>"It is not too much to assert, that all that can be said, or has been
  discovered about 'The little animal' (Puck), is gathered together in Dr.
  Bell's most amusing and instructive volume, which not only elucidates the
  mystery which hangs about it, but enters largely into all illustrations
  of the folk-lore and the superstitions of all nations, but especially of
  the earliest religious rites of Northern Europe and the Wends. It has
  always been a marvel how Shakspeare could have possessed the information
  which he made available in his plays. Dr. Bell proves that he must have
  possessed far greater facilities than we are aware of. The work, besides
  possessing these features, enters into further antiquarian researches of
  a learned character: and is one which cannot fail to be highly
  appreciated wherever it makes its way into circulation."&mdash;<i>Bell's
